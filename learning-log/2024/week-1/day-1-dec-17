Day 2 - December 17, 2024
Summary
Today focused on Python fundamentals from a data engineering perspective, with emphasis on understanding basic Python syntax and data structures while transitioning from Java knowledge.
Topics Covered

Python Basic Syntax

Understanding Python's indentation rules
The if __name__ == "__main__" pattern
Differences between Python and Java syntax


Data Structures

Lists (equivalent to Java ArrayList)
Dictionaries (equivalent to Java HashMap)
List comprehensions
Basic data operations


Python Features

F-string formatting
Built-in functions (sum, len, max, min)
Dictionary iteration
Terminal execution in VS Code



Code Examples Created
